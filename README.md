## Onshape Certification Prep: The Swing Arm


### Assignment Description

  * One of the goals of this class is to get you ready to earn your Certified Onshape Associate certification. This is a timed test that requires mastery of many different CAD concepts. As Engineering 3 or 4 students you have worked extensively with CAD, but you may have a different level of mastery from your fellow students. This assignment will help you determine what additional concepts you need to focus on for the certification exam.

### Reflection

   * This assignment was hard for me because I was not used to onahape this assignment helped me get used to onahpe. hard and I work with my friends and I help them also in this part of onshape I like onahspe and I enjoy onshape.
   *  For this assignment there was two parts and different masses the first mass was 871.72 and the second one was 2389.8.

##   photointerrupters

### Description and Code
 I need to Wire up your photointerrupter and have it keep track of how many times it has been interrupted.
Your program outputs the count using a full sentence like "The number of interrupts is: ___" or "I have been interrupted ___ times."
The program outputs the sentence every 4 seconds.
Don't use sleep(), use time.monotonic()Links to an external site. .
For your submission, if you have an LCD working, you can just take a video of you interrupting and then show the LCD.  Otherwise, you'll need to take a screenshot as well and upload that to your github repo.

##  Practice design from on shape : alignment plate


### Assignment Description

The Onshape CAD Challenges are a great way to practice for the Onshape Certification Exam. These challenges record the time you spent designing your Onshape document and allow you to compare your results with the average amount of time spent. It also checks your work automatically when you record the mass of a part.

### Reflection
 this assignment helped me learn more about how to use new tools on Onshape, it was a little bit hard but with the help of my friends 
 I did it

## CircuitPython Distance Sensor


Description & Code Snippets
I've broken the assignment into 3 stages, to make your life easier:

Use the HC-SR04 to measure the distance to an object and print that out to your serial monitor or LCD in cm. Next, you will get the neopixel to turn red when your object is less than 5cm, and green when its 35cm. Ignore the blue and 20cm for now, let's just keep it simple. For your final version of this code, you'll smoothly shift the color of the onboard neopixel, corresponding to the distance, according to the graphic below. (Neopixel should stay red when below 5cm and green when above 35cm)

if  btn2.value:
    print("BTN2 is pressed")
   

time.sleep(0.1) # sleep for debounce

### Reflection

In this assignment, I had little trouble with the coding pats but i finally did   and more wiring and the goal was that it should show us the Distance and help us to get used to coding.
