##   photointerrupters

### Description and Code
 I need to Wire up your photointerrupter and have it keep track of how many times it has been interrupted.
Your program outputs the count using a full sentence like "The number of interrupts is: ___" or "I have been interrupted ___ times."
The program outputs the sentence every 4 seconds.
Don't use sleep(), use time.monotonic()Links to an external site. .
For your submission, if you have an LCD working, you can just take a video of you interrupting and then show the LCD.  Otherwise, you'll need to take a screenshot as well and upload that to your github repo.

The Onshape CAD Challenges are a great way to practice for the Onshape Certification Exam. These challenges record the time you spent designing your Onshape document and allow you to compare your results with the average amount of time spent. It also checks your work automatically when you record the mass of a part.
